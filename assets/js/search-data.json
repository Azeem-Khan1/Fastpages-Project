A program starts with an idea | Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and follow a plan | Exploration is a crucial part of development | Developing a program investigate a problem/purpose and reflect Determine the requirements of the program | Understand constraints (features, time, etc…) | Understand user concerns and interests | Ways of investigating include: surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | . | Design the program brainstorm (think about how the investigation went) | storyboard the program | plan the user experience | lay out the UI | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Decide on program requirements Describe how the program should behave | Include a list of user interactions | . | Program specifications will outline all requirements | Developers create a prototype of the program or program components An incremental process is used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program | . | LOTS OF TESTING occurs at the: micro level (individual components) | macro level (entire program) | . | . | Developers refine and and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . | . Video 2 . Acknowledge code segments used from other sources Should include origin and author name | . | Programs are usually developed in teams | individuals/teams work on different functional components | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions | . | You can use comments in the programming to give credit | If there’s a bug or error in the program, then comments can help identify who is responsible This may be useful after a program is completed and users can find any additional bugs | . | Many times, developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more that are written by others similar to quoting someone in a paper | . | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms, etc… are considered the intellectual property of the author | May resemble a works cited page | . Video 3 . Program documentation A written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed | Comments can be made in a programming language as a form of documentation (will not affect how program runs) Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be required k | . | Programmers should document a program throughout its development | Helps in developing and maintaining correct programs | . | Step 1: create a program documentation describe overall program | list program specs function/procedures/methods within the code | Specific code segments | list events and corresponding outputs | describe development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list contributors/authors of the program | . | In the beginning: List specifications | . | During Development: Keep track of progress | . | At the end: Explain the overall process | . | Documenting throughout the programming can improve: efficiency | ability to test and refine the program | programmers’ response to bugs (tracking down errors) | . | Comments: allow programmers to write text within the program | Don’t affect the program | are for programmers to read, not the computer | are useful when programmers collaborate or work individually | In Python: (#) syntax | . | Java: (//) syntax for single line comments | (/* , */) Multiple line comments | (/** , */) Documentation comments | Similar to Javascript, C, C++, Swift | . | XML/HTML () syntax for single or multi line comments | . | Applescript/Pascal ((* , *)) syntax | . | Block based languages Scratch | MIT AppInventor | . | . | .",

            "content": "console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} . Build a Classroom Array/List of Persons and JSON . Many key elements are shown again. New elements include... . Building an Array, &quot;var students&quot; is an array of many persons | Building a Classroom, this show forEach iteration through an array and .push adding to an array. These are key concepts in all programming languages. | . // define a student Array of Person(s) var students = [ new Person(&quot;Anthony&quot;, &quot;tonyhieu&quot;, 2022), new Person(&quot;Bria&quot;, &quot;B-G101&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Allie&quot;, &quot;xiaoa0&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Tigran&quot;, &quot;Tigran7&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Rebecca-123&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Vidhi&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, 2024) ]; // define a classroom and build Classroom objects and json function Classroom(teacher, students){ // 1 teacher, many student // start Classroom with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); this.teacher = teacher; this.classroom = [teacher]; // add each Student to Classroom this.students = students; this.students.forEach(student =&gt; { student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); this.classroom.push(student); }); // build json/string format of Classroom this.json = []; this.classroom.forEach(person =&gt; this.json.push(person.toJSON())); } // make a CompSci classroom from formerly defined teacher and students compsci = new Classroom(teacher, students); // output of Objects and JSON in CompSci classroom logItType(compsci.classroom); // constructed classroom object logItType(compsci.classroom[0].name); // abstract 1st objects name logItType(compsci.json[0]); // show json conversion of 1st object to string logItType(JSON.parse(compsci.json[0])); // show JSON.parse inverse of JSON.stringify . object ; [ Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Anthony&#39;, ghID: &#39;tonyhieu&#39;, classOf: 2022, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Bria&#39;, ghID: &#39;B-G101&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Allie&#39;, ghID: &#39;xiaoa0&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Tigran&#39;, ghID: &#39;Tigran7&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Rebecca&#39;, ghID: &#39;Rebecca-123&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Vidhi&#39;, ghID: &#39;unknown&#39;, classOf: 2024, role: &#39;Student&#39; } ] string ; Mr M string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} object ; { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } . IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;background:black;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em #3E3E3E;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

First, I will make a start screen, which will display a title, the rules/instructions, and a button to start the game | Next, I will create a “gameplay” page, which will have about 30 circles (or targets) scattered throughout the screen, along with a score counter at the top and a 3, 2, 1, GO countdown | Then, I will create an end screen that will say “game over” and display the user’s score, along with a button to try again, which will redirect them back to the start screen | In case the user’s speed is insanely good, I created a “win” page just in case, and it will simply say “congratulations, you beat the game” and will have an option to play again | . Writing the Code (Basic layout) . Set the screen to the start screen | Declare a variable: score = 0 | Define a function to hide all elements on the gameplay screen | Call the function mentioned above when the “start game” button is clicked | Use the setTimeout block to code a countdown before the targets appear | Once the countdown is done, display the first target using the showElement block | When that target is clicked, hide that target | assign variable: score = score + 1 | setText of score box to the variable score | display new target | . | Copy and paste 29 times (I know there’s probably a faster way to do this with a function but this seemed easier to me and it still works how I want it to) | Use a setTimeout block to switch to the end screen after 15 seconds and setText to “You scored” + score | After target #30 is clicked, redirect the user to the win screen | If the “play again” button (on either the win or end screen) is clicked, redirect the user to the start screen | .

Discoveries, Challenges, and Successes . Block coding is a great introduction to a new language | It takes a long time to figure out how to program something you have in your head | There are various issues that come along with a theoretical plan | I was able to program my quiz so that the first question would be graded and the user could move on to the next question, but from there, I had a lot of trouble continuing that loop until the third question was answered (EDIT: I was able to find a way for this to work using stacked buttons) | Developing a good program takes a lot of trial, error, and debugging to make sure everything runs smoothly | I was able to build the quiz successfully eventually, you can access it here or in the embed above | . Program and Purpose . This program is a simple 3-question quiz about random automotive knowledge. It doesn&#39;t really have a purpose other than helping us experiment with AppLab and having something to submit for this hack . Data Abstraction . We used a data table with all of the question and answer values that we needed. We also figured out how to take values from that table and display them on the virtual screen using getColumn. . Managing Complexity . We originally were going to use button elements for the user to select an answer, but that would have made it a lot more complex to code, since they were able to select more than one choice at a time by default. Instead, we decided to use radio buttons, which only allow one selection at a time. This made it simpler to code, but also resulted in us having to figure out how to link those buttons to the choices they represent. . Procedural Abstraction . We utilized procedural abstraction in the Display function. This function displayed the question and the answer choices for a given problem (based on the parameter that is set when calling the function). For example, if the parameter is set to 0 and we call the Display function, it will display question #1 with its corresponding answer choices. . Algorithm Implementation . One algorithm that we programmed was to recognize which choice the user has selected and display different things in the answer indicator box after the check button is clicked based on if that choice is recognized as correct or incorrect. . Testing . After we finished a simple draft of the quiz, I asked another partnership to test it out and give us some tips. I also asked other people outside of class for feedback. One thing someone suggested was to add a start screen and an end screen. Another piece of feedback was that the user should receive a score at the end, so we implemented a start screen with a start button and an end screen that displays the score and a button to try again (which dumps the user back to the start screen). . Alternate App Idea . I think that programming an app where the user is able to create and store virtual flashcards would be interesting. .",

Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionary purpose (defining InfoDb) . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. | .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub).

Hacks . Go back to some of the deployment procedures and think about some thing you could verify through Bash notebook. . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. | Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? | How would you update a repository? | Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. | . Answers to Hacks . It may be possible to verify tools we install by running conditional commands to tell us if we have a certain version of something. | We can use conda list to verify all packages and version installed. | Use a git add command to add needed files, use git commit to commit to the correct repository, and use git push to push changes to repository. | We can program a scipt to automate an action. | .",
