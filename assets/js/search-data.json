Lists: a sequence of variables . we can use lists to store multiple items into one variable | used to store collections of data | changeable, ordered, allow duplicates | . List examples in Python, JavaScript, and Pseudocode. . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;] print (fruits) . const fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;]; . fruits ‚Üê [apple, grape, strawberry] .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . About Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterators, Iterable, and Iteration . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? | Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. | . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # using a for loop for i in list: #for item in the list, print the item print(i) .

A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . 2D Hack 1 . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] # I had to add keypad back here because it couldn&#39;t reference the one that was stated in a few cells above def print_matrix3(matrix): for row in matrix: print(*row) print_matrix3(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . 2D Hack 2 . def print_matrix4(matrix): matrix_iter = iter(matrix) for x in range(len(matrix)): inner_matrix_iter = iter(next(matrix_iter)) for y in matrix[x]: print(str(next(inner_matrix_iter)), end=&quot; &quot;) print() print_matrix4(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] month = keyboard[2][1] + keyboard[1][2] + keyboard[1][9] + keyboard[1][4] + keyboard[1][2] + keyboard[3][6] + keyboard[3][4] + keyboard[1][2] + keyboard[1][3] age = str(keyboard[0][1]) + str(keyboard[0][7]) print(&quot;My birth month: &quot; + month[:1] + month[1:].lower()) print(&quot;My age: &quot; + age) . My birth month: September My age: 17 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . def function(x, y): month = str(x).lower() + str(y).lower() keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] #Creates second dummy keyboard clearedKeyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] for i in string: #iterates through the keyboard for each item in month for j in range(len(keyboard)): for k in range(len(keyboard[j])): if i == str(keyboard[j][k]).lower(): keyboard[j][k] = &quot; &quot; for i in range(len(keyboard)): for j in range(len(keyboard[i])): if keyboard[i][j] != &quot; &quot;: keyboard[i][j] = &quot; &quot; else: keyboard[i][j] = clearedKeyboard[i][j] print_matrix1(keyboard) function(&quot;September&quot;, 1) .

            "content": "Algorithm . An algorithm typically means &#39;code&#39; that solves a problem. Designing an algorithm often requires you to learn the Tech first and then consider how you design your code and algorithms. Code design can take many iterations. . Truth Tables . My topic for this blog is Truth Tables. The illustration that follows displays the results of logical operators AND, OR, XOR, NOT versus binary 1 and 0. The output produces a &#39;Truth Table&#39;. . . Exploring Truth Tables operations . Exploration of this topic requires searching the language for logical operators, then figuring out how to display condition and test result. . Bitwise operations for Truth Tables typically represent 1 - True and 0 - False. | Logical expression in iteration and selection statements result in True or False | . My objective is Truth Tables. But in my exploration I did both Truth Table and Expression syntax . print(&quot;OR&quot;) print( &quot;1 | 0 = &quot;, 1 | 0) print( &quot;~(1 | 0) = &quot;, ~(1 | 0) % 2) # 1 is an integer, not a bit so remainder (modulo) does trick print(&quot;AND&quot;) print( &quot;1 &amp; 0 = &quot;, 1 &amp; 0) print( &quot;~(1 &amp; 0) = &quot;, ~(1 &amp; 0) % 2) # modulo again print(&quot;XOR&quot;) print( &quot;1 ^ 1 = &quot;, 1 ^ 1) print() # Boolean Tests print(&quot;Boolean OR&quot;) print( &quot;True or False = &quot;, True or False) print(&quot;Boolean AND&quot;) print( &quot;True and False = &quot;, True and False) print(&quot;Boolean XOR&quot;) print( &quot;True != True = &quot;, True != True) . OR 1 | 0 = 1 ~(1 | 0) = 0 AND 1 &amp; 0 = 0 ~(1 &amp; 0) = 1 XOR 1 ^ 1 = 0 Boolean OR True or False = True Boolean AND True and False = False Boolean XOR True != True = True . Algorithm 1 . This algorithm focuses on small reusable procedures/functions (def) for bitwise tests. From the exploratory experience above it seems like a lot of typing would be necessary to represent possibilities. . import operator # functions for all comparisons, logical operations, mathematical operations and sequence operations # builds truth table def truth_options(): a_opts = [1, 0] b_opts = [1, 0] return [(a, b) for a in a_opts for b in b_opts] # double for permutes options # provides equivalent function lookup for bitwise using operator functions def bitwise_options(op): ops = {&#39;&amp;&#39;: operator.and_, &#39;|&#39;: operator.or_, &#39;^&#39;: operator.xor} return ops[op] # control/eval for bitwise operators, selection is based on number of operators def bitwise_eval(op, op2=&quot;&quot;): if op2 == &quot;&quot;: op_func = bitwise_options(op) print(f&quot;Bitwise {op}&quot;) for a, b in truth_options(): print(f&quot;{a} {op} {b} is {op_func(a, b)}&quot;) else: op2_func = bitwise_options(op2) print(f&quot;Bitwise {op}&quot;) for a, b in truth_options(): print(f&quot;{op}({a} {op2} {b}) is {(1, 0)[op2_func(a, b)]}&quot;) # opposite: index 0 returns 1, index 1 return 0 def method1(): bitwise_eval(&quot;&amp;&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;NAND&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;|&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;NOR&quot;, &quot;|&quot;) bitwise_eval(&quot;^&quot;) # call bitwise evaluation of truth table if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: print(&quot;***** Method 1 *****&quot;) method1() . ***** Method 1 ***** Bitwise &amp; 1 &amp; 1 is 1 1 &amp; 0 is 0 0 &amp; 1 is 0 0 &amp; 0 is 0 Bitwise NAND NAND(1 &amp; 1) is 0 NAND(1 &amp; 0) is 1 NAND(0 &amp; 1) is 1 NAND(0 &amp; 0) is 1 Bitwise | 1 | 1 is 1 1 | 0 is 1 0 | 1 is 1 0 | 0 is 0 Bitwise NOR NOR(1 | 1) is 0 NOR(1 | 0) is 0 NOR(0 | 1) is 0 NOR(0 | 0) is 1 Bitwise ^ 1 ^ 1 is 0 1 ^ 0 is 1 0 ^ 1 is 1 0 ^ 0 is 0 . Truth Table - Algorithm 2 . This algorithm above seemed to me to lose clarity with all the functions. The second attempt focuses on truth tables as a linear sequence, with loops for required repetitions. This seemed more understandable to me than my 1st attempt. . def method2(): truth_table = [[1,1], [1,0], [0,1], [0,0]] for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;and {a} &amp; {b}: {a &amp; b}&quot;) for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;nand ~({a} &amp; {b}): {((a &amp; b) + 1) % 2}&quot;) # warning: ~ negates entire integer without modulo for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;or {a} | {b}: {a | b}&quot;) for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;nor ~({a} | {b}): {((a | b) + 1) % 2}&quot;) # warning: see above for a, b in truth_table: print(f&quot;xor {a} ^ {b}: {a ^ b}&quot;) # call bitwise evaluation of truth table if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: print(&quot;***** Method 2 *****&quot;) method2() . ***** Method 2 ***** and 1 &amp; 1: 1 and 1 &amp; 0: 0 and 0 &amp; 1: 0 and 0 &amp; 0: 0 nand ~(1 &amp; 1): 0 nand ~(1 &amp; 0): 1 nand ~(0 &amp; 1): 1 nand ~(0 &amp; 0): 1 or 1 | 1: 1 or 1 | 0: 1 or 0 | 1: 1 or 0 | 0: 0 nor ~(1 | 1): 0 nor ~(1 | 0): 0 nor ~(0 | 1): 0 nor ~(0 | 0): 1 xor 1 ^ 1: 0 xor 1 ^ 0: 1 xor 0 ^ 1: 1 xor 0 ^ 0: 0 . Linear Sequence of code . The order of executions is strictly from top to bottom. This is good for learning, but is typically a poor method for an Algorithm! This was my 1st exploration above. . Procedure (Function) . A Procedure is a set of code instructions that has been abstracted into logical parts. Each code abstraction is called &quot;Procedural Abstraction&quot;. . In Python, using procedures (def) means you are starting to write &quot;good&quot; code vs &quot;bad&quot; code, mostly in terms of reusability of logic. | A procedure needs to be activated or called, this is performed in the main selections above. | . Hacks . As we explore the algorithm Unit students will be designing lessons and homework. Each lesson will have Hacks. Here are some hacks that could go with the lesson above. The three weeks after Thanksgiving will be focused on this activity and build personal portfolio. . Try to build a Truth Table as shown above in Python, but switch to JavaScript... .

An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) .

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend.

Python code that support Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD): https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio/blob/main/model_jokes.py | . | . Hacks . Find and use an API as part of your project. An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .

Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Mr M&#39;, ghID: &#39;jm1021&#39;, classOf: 1977, role: &#39;Teacher&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Mr M&#34;,&#34;ghID&#34;:&#34;jm1021&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1977,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Teacher&#34;} .

IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;background:black;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em #3E3E3E;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

First, I will make a start screen, which will display a title, the rules/instructions, and a button to start the game | Next, I will create a ‚Äúgameplay‚Äù page, which will have about 30 circles (or targets) scattered throughout the screen, along with a score counter at the top and a 3, 2, 1, GO countdown | Then, I will create an end screen that will say ‚Äúgame over‚Äù and display the user‚Äôs score, along with a button to try again, which will redirect them back to the start screen | In case the user‚Äôs speed is insanely good, I created a ‚Äúwin‚Äù page just in case, and it will simply say ‚Äúcongratulations, you beat the game‚Äù and will have an option to play again | .

Block coding is a great introduction to a new language | It takes a long time to figure out how to program something you have in your head | There are various issues that come along with a theoretical plan | I was able to program my quiz so that the first question would be graded and the user could move on to the next question, but from there, I had a lot of trouble continuing that loop until the third question was answered (EDIT: I was able to find a way for this to work using stacked buttons) | Developing a good program takes a lot of trial, error, and debugging to make sure everything runs smoothly | I was able to build the quiz successfully eventually, you can access it here or in the embed above | . Program and Purpose . This program is a simple 3-question quiz about random automotive knowledge. It doesn&#39;t really have a purpose other than helping us experiment with AppLab and having something to submit for this hack . Data Abstraction . We used a data table with all of the question and answer values that we needed. We also figured out how to take values from that table and display them on the virtual screen using getColumn. . Managing Complexity . We originally were going to use button elements for the user to select an answer, but that would have made it a lot more complex to code, since they were able to select more than one choice at a time by default. Instead, we decided to use radio buttons, which only allow one selection at a time. This made it simpler to code, but also resulted in us having to figure out how to link those buttons to the choices they represent. . Procedural Abstraction . We utilized procedural abstraction in the Display function. This function displayed the question and the answer choices for a given problem (based on the parameter that is set when calling the function). For example, if the parameter is set to 0 and we call the Display function, it will display question #1 with its corresponding answer choices. . Algorithm Implementation . One algorithm that we programmed was to recognize which choice the user has selected and display different things in the answer indicator box after the check button is clicked based on if that choice is recognized as correct or incorrect. . Testing . After we finished a simple draft of the quiz, I asked another partnership to test it out and give us some tips. I also asked other people outside of class for feedback. One thing someone suggested was to add a start screen and an end screen. Another piece of feedback was that the user should receive a score at the end, so we implemented a start screen with a start button and an end screen that displays the score and a button to try again (which dumps the user back to the start screen). . Alternate App Idea . I think that programming an app where the user is able to create and store virtual flashcards would be interesting. .",

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries (In-Class) . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionary purpose (defining InfoDb) . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. | . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # PUTTING MY INFORMATION (HACK!)

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub).

Hacks . Go back to some of the deployment procedures and think about some thing you could verify through Bash notebook. . Is there anything we use to verify tools we install? Think about versions. | Is there anything we could verify with Anaconda? | How would you update a repository? | Really cool would be automating a procedure from installation. | . Answers to Hacks . It may be possible to verify tools we install by running conditional commands to tell us if we have a certain version of something. | We can use conda list to verify all packages and version installed. | Use a git add command to add needed files, use git commit to commit to the correct repository, and use git push to push changes to repository. | We can program a scipt to automate an action. | .",
