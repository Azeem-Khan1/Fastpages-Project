# Hacks
1. Remote theme
    - Before remote theme:
    ![Before ss 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Fastpage before remote theme.jpg)
    ![Before ss 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Fastpage before remote theme 2.jpg)

    - After remote theme:
    ![after ss 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Fastpage hacker theme 1.jpg)
    ![after ss 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Fastpage hacker theme 2.jpg)

### Observations
- One thing I am 100% confident in is that I like how the default "miniima" theme looks
- The dark mode makes it very hard to read most of the text in the "Hacker" remote theme
- The remote theme looks a lot more vintage
- Remote theme does not support "pages" layout like the default (the little tabs in the top right become links instead)
- Hacker theme lacked organization and sectioning
- Looked like it was from the dinosaur era

2. Time box is implemented on my [Notes](https://azeem-khan1.github.io/fastpages-project/notes/) page to organize my notes.
