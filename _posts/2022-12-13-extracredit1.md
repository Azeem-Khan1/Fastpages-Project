# More Notes from the Q&A

- Agile methodology differs between companies depending on scrum size

- Always start looking for a new job before you lose your current one (or see signs of loosing your current one)

- Be ADAPTIVE
- Keep LEARNING

- Know how to listen to requirements and translate in terms of how the technology can meet them

- Ridiculous interviews nowadays (compile code that solves a problem in 30-45 min)

- Twitter University / Meta University teaches how the systems work because they are built there. Cannot be found anywhere else. (Different from Flask or Nginx)

- Knowing how to code effectively is not just a skill, it's a way of thinking (problem solving, growth mindset, etc...)
