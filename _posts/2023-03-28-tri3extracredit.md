## Electronics Activity

- After the lecture, the guest speakers brought out some electronic supplies consisting of the following
    - Button batteries
    - Vibration motors
    - Toothbrush heads
    - Electrical tape
- We were supposed to make vibrating toothbrushes but some of the motors were the wrong kind and they just spun the bristle-haed
- We had a lot of fun figuring out how to properly tape the ends of the wires to the battery to keep the motor on, and taping the toothbrush head onto the powered end of the motor

## Reflection

> I had loads of fun at this guest speaker lecture. I met up with some friends who I hadn't seen in a while along with learning about the ins and outs of the Comp Sci program at Cal State San Marcos, as well as other general college knowledge. There were some valuable life lessons thrown in there as well, which were also pretty beneficial. My favorite part was the electronics activity where we had to figure out how to make an electronically powered vibrating toothbrush. It was fun seeing my friends struggle with it, but just a super enjoyable experience in general (I also like physics so that was kind of my cup of tea). Overall, I'd say 9/10 experience for me.
