# Video Notes
## Video 1
- Innovations can be physical (like a self-driving car) or non-physical (like computing software)
- Working in pairs can lead to more good ideas that can be implemented into a program
- Collaboration helps avoid bias in development
- Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it
- Interpersonal skills learned through collaboration
    - Communication
    - Consensus Building
    - Conflict Resolution
    - Negotiation
- If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

## Video 2
- Pair programming
    - Driver: writes code
    - Observer: reviews each line of code as it's typed in (helps understanding; ask questions and/or give feedback if needed)
    - Do NOT be a backseat programmer
- Think-Pair-Share
    - Think through a problem alone
    - Share ideas with a partner
    - Share results with the class

    - Acknowledge code segments and media used from other resources
    - Differentiate what each person did

# Hacks (answers)

- My group is neither set up strictly on the basis of current friends, although we get along well, nor on common interests other than Computer Science
- My group is set up with diversity in backgrounds and perspectives, however not that much diversity in gender. I don't believe that is a huge deal for us though
- My group is very well equipped for the skill sets needed for success in the classroom
