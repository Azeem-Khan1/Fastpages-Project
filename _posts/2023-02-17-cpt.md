# Write-up (Reaction Time)

## 3a.

### 3.a.i.
This program is a cure to boredom and provides a fun and competitive experience while testing the user's reaction time.

### 3.a.ii.
This program allows a user to test their reaction time by awarding points every time they click a circular target. After each click, the target is relocated at a random position in the game container. The user has 15 seconds to accumulate the highest score they can. This ties in with a larger project in which there is a currency system. The user must pay 15 tokens in order to play and is rewarded in tokens, which are dependant on the user's score.
