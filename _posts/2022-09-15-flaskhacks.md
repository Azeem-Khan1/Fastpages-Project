### Customization
- In base.html:
    - Title the site ***The Dream Team***
    - Upload a funny image of Shaq to the repository and set it as the site logo
- Make edits to the Stub page in stub.html (now called the *Why* page (See the next step))
- Make edits to navbar.html
    - Change the *Stub* page to the *Why* page
    - Change the *Projects* dropdown to the *User Profiles* dropdown
    - Customize each option in the *User Profiles* dropdown to match each member of the group
- Mess around with projects.html and change the look of the buttons on each page
    - Set it to only display one button labeled ***Fastpages Project***
    - Set it to only display one icon in the top left (links to the GitHub repo)
- Make edits to my corresponding .html file under /bp_projects/templates
    - link the existing "Fastpages Project" button to my actual blog
    - I didn't want to mess up the background at all

This is what it looks like now:
