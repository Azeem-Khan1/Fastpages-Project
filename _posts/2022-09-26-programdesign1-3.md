# Hacks
## Notes
### Video 1
- A program starts with an idea
- Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind
- Developers follow specific steps and follow a plan
- Exploration is a crucial part of development
- Developing a program
    - investigate a problem/purpose and reflect
        - Determine the requirements of the program
        - Understand constraints (features, time, etc...)
        - Understand user concerns and interests
        - Ways of investigating include:
            - surveys
            - user testing
            - interviews
            - direct observations
    - Design the program
        - brainstorm (think about how the investigation went)
        - storyboard the program
        - plan the user experience
        - lay out the UI
        - organizing into modules
        - develop a testing strategy
    - Decide on program requirements
        - Describe how the program should behave
        - Include a list of user interactions
    - Program specifications will outline all requirements
    - Developers create a prototype of the program or program components
        - An incremental process is used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program
    - LOTS OF TESTING
        - occurs at the:
            - micro level (individual components)
            - macro level (entire program)
    - Developers refine and and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection

### Video 2
- Acknowledge code segments used from other sources
    - Should include origin and author name
- Programs are usually developed in teams
- individuals/teams work on different functional components
- Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work
    - Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions
- You can use comments in the programming to give credit
- If there's a bug or error in the program, then comments can help identify who is responsible
    - This may be useful after a program is completed and users can find any additional bugs
- Many times, developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more that are written by others
    - similar to quoting someone in a paper
- Any code segments, procedures, algorithms, etc... are considered the intellectual property of the author
- May resemble a works cited page

### Video 3
- Program documentation
    - A written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed
    - Comments can be made in a programming language as a form of documentation (will not affect how program runs)
        - Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be required  k
    - Programmers should document a program throughout its development
    - Helps in developing and maintaining correct programs
- Step 1: create a program documentation
    - describe overall program
    - list program specs
        - function/procedures/methods within the code
        - Specific code segments
        - list events and corresponding outputs
        - describe development of the program
        - how other programs may interact with the program
    - list contributors/authors of the program
- In the beginning:
    - List specifications
- During Development:
    - Keep track of progress
- At the end:
    - Explain the overall process
- Documenting throughout the programming can improve:
    - efficiency
    - ability to test and refine the program
    - programmers' response to bugs (tracking down errors)
- Comments:
    - allow programmers to write text within the program
    - Don't affect the program
    - are for programmers to read, not the computer
    - are useful when programmers collaborate or work individually
    - In Python:
        - (#) syntax
    - Java:
        - (//) syntax for single line comments
        - (/* , */) Multiple line comments
        - (/** , */) Documentation comments
        - Similar to Javascript, C, C++, Swift
    - XML/HTML
        - (<!--, -->) syntax for single or multi line comments
    - Applescript/Pascal
        - ((* , *)) syntax
    - Block based languages
        - Scratch
        - MIT AppInventor
