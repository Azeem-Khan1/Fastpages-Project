# Hacks
## Note of Gratitude
I'm grateful for Varalu because he always helps me a lot if I'm confused on something and he's a smart, kind person as well.

## Gratitude list
See the [Gratitude List](https://azeem-khan1.github.io/fastpages-project/gratitudelist/) page (can also be found on the top right of the site)

## Goals
- End this trimester with straight A's
- Actively participate when possible
- Engage in extracurriculars such as DNMP, Key Club, SAT, and MSA

Achieving goals like these connect to the feeling of happiness because it keeps you busy and not bored. You might also find a new hobby.
