# 5.1 Blog Post Reflection

Three beneficial/harmful effects of CS:

1. Increased Productivity and Efficiency: On one hand, computer science has revolutionized the way we live and work by providing faster and more efficient tools for communication, data processing, and problem solving. On the other hand, it has also led to job automation and the elimination of many manual labor jobs, resulting in a decrease in employment opportunities.

2. Improved Education and Access to Information: The internet and computer technology have greatly expanded the access to educational resources and information, allowing people to learn and grow in ways that were once impossible. However, this has also contributed to the spread of false and misleading information, as well as increased distractions and decreased focus and attention spans.

3. Greater Connectivity and Globalization: The rise of computer technology has allowed people to connect and communicate in ways that were once impossible, bridging geographical and cultural divides. This has resulted in greater collaboration and understanding between different communities, but it has also contributed to the spread of hate speech, cyber-bullying, and a decline in personal interactions and face-to-face communication.

Benefits of our project:
- Entertaining for the user if they are bored
- It's a good way to spend time with friends or family and have fun together
- It's a learning experience for everyone involved

Potential con of our project:
- It may be slightly buggy (it was developed by high schoolers)

Dopamine issues:

> Modern technology has led to a lot more issues of people, especially teens, being desensitized to dopamine. This is why dopamine detox lifestyles are common in people who want to better themselves. Nowadays things like social media provide people with dopamine with the simple action of a scroll from one 15 second video to another. This is also one reason why the attention span of people has decreased to under 10 seconds. To combat this, content creators have adapted their products to amuse the viewer within those 10 seconds, giving the viewer a boost of dopamine that otherwise would not have happened. These continuous boosts of dopamine pose a problem with the desensitization of dopamine among teens and may explain the increased rates of depression and anxiety in Gen Z kids. I personally would say that I spend an extended amount of time on social media. Although this has not affected my personal study and success in High School at all (as I've earned a 4.00 unweighted GPA, have a good social life, and am invested in hobbies such as music and cars), I still believe I should consider decreasing my cell-phone use in general.

Steps to digital empowerment:
1. Develop digital literacy skills: Learn how to use technology effectively and safely, including online privacy and security.
2. Build a strong online presence: Develop a personal brand and create a professional profile on social media platforms.
3. Protect personal data: Secure passwords, limit personal information shared online, and be aware of potential scams.
4. Stay informed: Stay updated with the latest technology trends and advancements to be able to make informed decisions.
5. Network and collaborate: Connect with like-minded people and build a professional network.
6. Continuously learn and adapt: Stay curious and open to learning new skills and technologies to stay ahead in a constantly evolving digital world.

As I would consider myself relatively digitally empowered, some ways I can help someone who is not empowered include:
1. Showing them how to do something they need to do (step by step)
2. Giving rules of thumb here and there
3. Helping them set up their technology and tools for how they will use them.

> Paper and red tape can act as barriers to digital empowerment, as they can slow down processes and limit access to information. These traditional systems can be time-consuming and bureaucratic, making it difficult for individuals to access resources or services. By digitizing information and processes, governments, organizations, and individuals can reduce the burden of paper and red tape, making it easier for individuals to access information and services, which in turn can promote digital empowerment. An example of something like this at Del Norte is the list of sites that PUSD admin decide to block on school wifi. I do understand that some sites should be blocked, like those that contain NSFW content or are known for privacy issues. However, in the time I've taken this Computer Science course, I've had to bypass the school wifi restrictions multiple times with a VPN or hotspot just to access something that I actually need in order to succeed in the class, which is definitely a problem.
