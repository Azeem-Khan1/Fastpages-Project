![Q11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111464932/235572083-8b2adf25-9b0b-4e0c-b97a-345b67cb6d62.png)

My answer: (B) III only

Correct answer: (D) I, II, and III

> For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function. Algorithm I accesses elements 2n times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses n^2 elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm III accesses 10 elements, which is considered reasonable time.
