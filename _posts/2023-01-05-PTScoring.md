# Reflection

I think my scoring is pretty similar to the CollegeBoard scores that these samples recieved. I have a decent understanding of the criteria and what my project needs in order to succeed. In order to fulfill all requirements, my project must be well-rounded and include a variety of functions and abstraction. Organization is also one thing I noticed may be important in the process of development. One of the most prominent reasons a submission may not have met the criteria in one area was a lack of detail in explaining how something works. I will make note of that and be sure to explain everything I can in as much detail as possible in order to make it clear how my project meets the standards.
