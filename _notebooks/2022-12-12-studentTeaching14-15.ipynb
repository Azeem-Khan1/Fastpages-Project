    "# Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "* A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. \n",
    "* These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs.\n",
    "* A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are libraries important?\n",
    "* Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. \n",
    "* One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. \n",
    "* Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few libraries that simplify coding processes:\n",
    "* **Pillow** allows you to work with images.\n",
    "* **Tensor Flow** helps with data automation and monitors performance.\n",
    "* **Matplotlib** allows you to make 2D graphs and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library!\n",

    "\n",
    "## Hacks:\n",
    "Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API’s\n",
    "* An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. \n",
    "* An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code.\n",
