    "### v. Explains how the selected list manages complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"chars\" is a dictionary that manages complexity by storing characters based on their format (i.e. capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols). This is essential to the complexity of the program because it makes it very efficient to identify which types of characters are allowed when generating a password, based on which content preferences the user has selected. It does this by concatenating all of the allowed characters into an indexable string \"selectedChars\", which is made up of the selected character types that can be accessed in \"chars\". An alternative way of identifying the allowed characters would be to store all characters in existence as separate items in an array, then categorizing each one based on its format to then be sorted into a collection of filtered characters. However, this is more complex because it would take many more processes to filter each item into a category based on it's format, whereas \"chars\" already stores the data that way while making it much more accessible.\n",

    "Then, provide a written response that does both of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### iii. Describes in general what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure here is called \"generate\". It takes in a parameter of \"passwordLen\", which is the desired password length that's inputted by the user. The procedure checks which content settings the user has selected, then checks if the inputted length is valid through a process of selection with an if-statement. Finally, it randomly generates a string of characters that is of the desired length and content using if-statements and a for-loop. This contributes to the overall functionality of the program because it achieves the main goal, which is to output a randomly generated password of a certain length and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### iv. Explains in detailed steps how the algorithm implemented in the identified procedure works. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the procedure initializes the string \"selectedChars\". Next, it calls the function \"isChecked\" four times, once for each checkbox element. This will update \"selectedChars\" with all characters that are allowed to be in the generated password, based upon which types of characters the user has selected to be in the password. Next, it identifies where the output should be displayed and saves it as a constant \"outputField\". Then, it checks if \"passwordLen\", the desired password length inputted by the user, is invalid by using an if-statement and logical OR operators to see if it's empty, under less than or equal to 2, or greater than 99. If it's invalid, it displays an error message in the \"outputField\". If it's valid, then it initializes the string \"pswd\", then iterates the following steps over \"i\", initialized at 0, when \"i\" is less than the \"passwordLen\": it checks if the length of \"selectedChars\" is greater than 0, meaning the user has selected at least one type of character for the password to be. If it is over 0, then it generates a random number \"c\" between 0 and the length of \"selectedChars\" minus 1 (to account for the index starting at 0), concatenates \"pswd\" with the character at the index \"c\" in \"selectedChars\", and displays \"pswd\" in \"outputField\". Otherwise, if the length of \"selectedChars\" is less than or equal to 0, it displays an error message in \"outputField\".\n",
