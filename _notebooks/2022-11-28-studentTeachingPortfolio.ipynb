    "        - NAMING:\n",
    "            - use general terms\n",
    "            - keep it concise\n",
    "            - use consistent notation (caps, etc...)\n",

    "- Provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation\n",
    "- Lists and Strings\n",
    "    - List = ordered sequence of elements\n",
    "    - Element = individual value in a list that is assigned to a unique index\n",
    "    - Index = a way to reference the elements in a list or string using natural numbers; each element of a string is referenced by an index\n",

    "### Managing Lists\n",
    "- 3 Types of List Operations\n",
    "    - Assigning values to a list at certain indices\n",
    "    - Creating an empty list and assigning it to a variable\n",
    "    - Assigning a copy of one list to another list (setting one list equal to another list)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Managing complexity\n",
    "    - Helps improve readability\n",
    "    - Reduces the need for new variables as more data is collected\n",
