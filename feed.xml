A database and storing persistent data is a primary focus of most backend systems. An SQLite Database using the Python SQLAlchemy framework will be the outcome of this lesson. As students learn databases using SQLAlchemy, they will also learn about Object-oriented programming in Python.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">View and Frontend Coding</title><link href="https://azeem-khan1.github.io/fastpages-project/week18/PBLview" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="View and Frontend Coding" /><published>2023-01-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://azeem-khan1.github.io/fastpages-project/week18/PBL-view</id><author><name></name></author><category term="week 18" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Frontend coding and backend design will always be related.
